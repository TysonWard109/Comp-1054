            <blockquote>
            <p>I'm always screamin' my lungs out 'til my head starts spinnin'
            Playin' my songs is the way I cope with life
            Won't keep my voice down
            Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
            I like to keep things honest
            I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
            I'd hate to keep you all wonderin'
            I'm constant like the seasons, I will never be forgotten, man
            Let's leave no words unspoken
            And save regrets for the broken
            Will you even look back when you think of me?<br></p>
            <p><em> All I want is a place to call my own
            To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
            Whoa, you know
            To keep your hopes up high and your head down low
            Keep your hopes up high and your head down low
            </em></p>

            <blockquote>
           <p>Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'<br>
            While everyone around me says my last days are looming overhead
            But just what the hell do they think they know?
            My head's above the water while they drown in the undertow
            Let's leave no words unspoken
            And save regrets for the broken
            Will you even look back when you think of me?
            </p> 
            <p><em> All I want is a place to call my own
            To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone

            To keep your hopes up high and your head down low
            Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

            <p>If you take it from me
            Live your life for yourself
            'Cause when it's all said and done
            You don't need anyone else, come on
            So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
            Not a worry in the world, tell me, was it all worth it?
            I get what I want, so everyone's always judgin' me
            Not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me
            </p>
            <p><em> All I want is a place to call my own
            To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
            Whoa, you know
            To keep your hopes up high and your head down low
            Keep your hopes up high and your head down low
            Keep your head down low
            Keep your head down low
            Keep your hopes up high and your head down low
