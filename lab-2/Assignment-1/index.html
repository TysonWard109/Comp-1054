            <h3>Why I chose this song</h3>
            <p>I chose this song because it has resonated with me since I was a teenager. It has always been a source of comfort and inspiration for me to keep my hopes up high and my head down low.</p>

            <h3>All I want</h3>
            <p>I'm always screamin' my lungs out 'til my head starts spinnin'<br>

            Playin' my songs is the way I cope with life<br>

            Won't keep my voice down<br>

            Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud<br>

            I like to keep things honest
            I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real<br>

            I'd hate to keep you all wonderin'<br>

            I'm constant like the seasons, I will never be forgotten, man<br>

            Let's leave no words unspoken
            And save regrets for the broken<br>

            Will you even look back when you think of me?<br></p>

            <p><em> All I want is a place to call my own<br>
            To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone<br>
            Whoa, you know<br>

            To keep your hopes up high and your head down low<br>

            Keep your hopes up high and your head down low
            </em></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <p>Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'<br>

            While everyone around me says my last days are looming overhead<br>

            But just what the hell do they think they know?<br>

            My head's above the water while they drown in the undertow<br>

            Let's leave no words unspoken
            And save regrets for the broken<br>

            Will you even look back when you think of me?
            </p>

        <p>If you take it from me<br>

        Live your life for yourself<br>

        'Cause when it's all said and done
        You don't need anyone else, come on<br>

        So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect<br>

        Not a worry in the world, tell me, was it all worth it?<br>

        I get what I want, so everyone's always judgin' me<br>

        Not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me
        </p>
